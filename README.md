## Module Overview

In the digital era, we are bombarded by humongous streams of
information. Sometimes, these 'inputs' are not interesting enough to
breach the defensive barriers that protect our attention ‚Äî hence, we
simply decide to pass over. Other times, what we are exposed seems
valuable, but we do not see any neat, meaningful pattern in it (that's
the bottom line as it comes to crunch massive datasets!!). According to
the popular idiom *"one picture is worth a thousand words"*, all what
messengers and audiences need to 'click' is ‚Äî often-times ‚Äî just a
simple, effective visualization.

This module is a journey into the art and science of creating memorable
charts, which grab the attention of the audience and successfully convey
insights and narratives. Pleasant journeys require good companions:
'infographic' ‚Äî i.e., the field that investigates the representation of
information, data, and knowledge ‚Äî will offer the theoretical platform
for the module; Python will make things happen (at least on our screen).
Consistently with the teaching philosophy of the module leader, each
individual lecture integrates 'theory' and 'practice'.

## Materials & Readings

For SMM635, you aren't required to purchase any book, whereas it is key 
you carefully consider the following set of __mandatory materials__:

- weekly [lecture notes](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/blob/58f3593a033ac65142b512cdae15d337e1476a5f/lectureNotes)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of the module, students should be able to:

- generate and evaluate visual forms for appropriateness, context, and
  meaning
- design and execute statistical charts with a particular emphasis on
  massive datasets
- design and execute complex visualizations involving timeliness and
  geospatial attributes
- design and execute interactive visualizations
- leverage the visualization capabilities of best in class such as Python 
  libraries [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/)

## Assessment

As per the module specification, students will be assessed on the basis
of coursework submissions (yes, you understand correctly, for this module there 
is no final examination). Specifically, there are two pieces of coursework, 
namely:

- a 'mid-term project' (MTP)
- a 'final course project' (FCP)

__Both pieces of coursework__ will be evaluated along four criteria: i)
appropriate use of notions and frameworks discussed in class; ii)
effectiveness of the proposed answer or solution; iii)
originality/creativity of the proposed answer or solution; iv)
organization and clarity of submitted materials. All criteria carry-out
equal weight in terms of marking.

### Mid-term project

For the MTP, students will work in __groups__ to solve a complex visualization
problem. The details of the MTP will be available on October 20, when the
project will be released. Submissions will be assessed on a 0 - 100% scale. The
Groups who fail MTP can resubmit a revised version of the project; if the
revision is sufficient, students receive a 50% mark. The deadline for the
project is November 15. Few groups (e.g., three) will be invited to present the
outcome of their work to fellow students in week 6.  Invited groups could also
receive a maximum of 3 bonus points on the basis of the quality of their
presentations.

To clarify your expectations about the MTP, please consider the [assignments
administered to the previous BA cohorts](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/blob/c3eb44673454d975a2a5c92db514daf5fb5ac5b4/pastAssignments).

### Final course project

With the FCP, students will work __individually__ to help a real-world client 
to face some data visualization challenges. Details about the client and the
challenge will be available on November 17. Final course projects will be
evaluated on a rolling basis and should be submitted by early January
(e.g., January 7 ‚Äî the course office will confirm the exact deadline shortly).

To clarify your expectations about the FCP, please consider the [assignments
administered to the previous BA cohorts](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/blob/c3eb44673454d975a2a5c92db514daf5fb5ac5b4/pastAssignments).
## Case studies

Case studies provide students with the opportunity to learn how to integrate
the 'business' and the 'data viz' perspectives in order to deal
effectively with real-world problems. In terms of process, groups of students
will receive i) a detailed description of a business issue, and ii) relevant
data. Then, they will be working for one week to produce their own solution.
The views on the case will be discussed in class during an interactive session
led by the lecturer. Students could be cold-called during the session and asked
to share their solution.

## Discretionary coursework

__Problem sets (PS)__ will be launched weekly. Individual students may want to deal
these problem sets and present their solution to the class. A maximum of three
students per session will be selected on the basis of the novelty and
effectiveness of the proposed solution. One bonus point (+1 FM) will be
assigned.

To clarify your expectations about PSs, please consider the [assignments
administered to the previous BA cohorts](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/blob/c3eb44673454d975a2a5c92db514daf5fb5ac5b4/pastAssignments).

## Guest speakers

Subject to the Covid-19-related norms and actions, SMM635 might host short talks
from two types of guest speakers: ambassadors ‚Äî former students of the BA 
program ‚Äî and practitioners.

## Prerequisites

The SMM692 ‚Äï Python Pre-Course module defines the knowledge students
should possess in order to proficiently attend to SMM635 ‚Äï Data
Visualization.

A minimal understanding of 

## Software requirements

For this module you are supposed to run Python 3.7 or higher on your machine. Now,
how to get Python work on your machine? There are several ways to do
that. A fast, smooth alternative is to install
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/), an open source
distribution of Python that includes: i) 250+ popular data science
packages; ii) the [conda](https://conda.io/docs/index.html) package,
which makes quick and easy to install, run, and upgrade complex data
science and machine learning environments.

Here is the workflow:

1. Use your preferred browser to open the link pointing to the
   [Anaconda repository](http://www.numpy.org/)
2. Select the installer the which suits your machine (32- or 64-bit)
   and operating system (Win, Mac OS, Linux). Mac users may want to
   download the graphical installer rather than the command-line
   installer (students may feel less comfortable with)
3. Retrieve the installer (perhaps in your download folder)
4. Run the installer
5. Log-out from your current session (it does not matter if you use
   Win, Mac OS or Linux)
6. Log-in into a new session
7. Run 'Anaconda Navigator' ‚Äî namely, a convenient place to launch the
   IPython shell or other user-interfaces to interact with IPython.

On top of Anaconda/Python, students should install the modules
[Matplotlib](https://networkx.github.io/),
[Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/),
[Fiona](http://toblerity.org/fiona/manual.html),
[Pyshp](https://glenbambrick.com/tag/pyshp/),
[Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
[Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) (I
recommend doing that with Conda).

The [envSetup](https://github.com/simoneSantoni/data-viz-smm635/blob/2ef404c852f5d91def12d4b2e50687959e60c94e/envSetup) 
folder contains some resources that assist you to set up your Python 
environment.
