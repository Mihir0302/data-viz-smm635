# Introduction

This final course project deals with the genesis and the transformation of Tech City (aka Silicon Roundabout), one of the most prominent technology-based clusters in the world.

# Problem to address

The students are required to jointly use geospatial analysis and dynamic visualization to represent the emergence and transformation of Tech City. The audience is difficult to frame – the visualization should be included in a blog talking about digital technologies and societies.

# Background for the case study

To deliver the project, students may want to:

- conduct a qualitative/historical investigation of the history of Tech city
- appreciate the existence of key events or policy making decisions that could have represented turning points in the lifecycle of Tech City

# Data

## Source

Data come from the archives of Companies House. Regarding data access:

- company-level data on UK-based businesses can be retrieved from the archived of [Free Company Data Product](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html)
- founder-level data can be retrieved from the archive [People with
  significant control(PSC)](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_pscdata.html) snapshot

## Data tables

Key information about the data and users guidance are available in the
[Companies
House](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/companies-house-data-products#comp-data)
website and in this [companion
document](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/426891/uniformResourceIdentifiersCustomerGuide.pdf).

# Deliverables

Students are required to submit:

1. a html file with the proposed visualization(s)
2. the code/data necessary to reproduce the visualization
3. a companion document that explains the background for the visualization (e.g., literature, white papers, technical reports, design decisions)

Upload the slideshow via Moodle by December 17 (16:00).
